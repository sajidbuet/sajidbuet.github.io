	abstract     = {Photonic topological insulators provide unidirectional, robust, wavelength-selective transport of light at an interface while keeping it insulated at the bulk of the material. The non-trivial topology results in an immunity to backscattering, sharp turns, and fabrication defects. This work leverages these unique properties to design a 2-channel optical demultiplexer based on a lithium niobate photonic topological insulator with piezoelectric switch-off capabilities. A photonic topological insulator design for the demultiplexer allows for good wavelength selectivity, crosstalk as low as {\textminus}54 dB, and better isolation between output channels. The primary operating wavelengths presented are the telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1550 nm, but the use of the lithium niobate material allows operation at multiple operating wavelengths. Furthermore, we propose a post-fabrication method to switch off the topological protection and, thus, optical transmittance via an applied voltage utilizing the inverse piezoelectric effect of lithium niobate. This work will contribute to advancing lithium niobate integrated photonics and developing efficient, multi-wavelength, electrically controlled optical communication systems and integrated photonic circuits.}

This article focuses on analyzing and studying first-principles density functional theory to assess the influence of strain on the phonon, mechanical, optical, and electronic characteristics of SiC. Additionally, we investigate the band structure for spin-orbit coupling. The SiC exhibits an indirect bandgap, but applying tensile strain it shows a direct bandgap. Although the bandgap decreases under tensile stresses and the SOC effect, it increases when exposed to compressive pressures. Furthermore, the optical characteristics of single-layer SiC, such as the refractive index, electron energy loss spectra, dielectric spectra, and absorption coefficient, showcase its remarkable capacity to effectively absorb light in both the visible and infrared (IR) regions. SiC exhibits dynamic and mechanical stability under compressive strain up to 3\% and under tensile strain up to +6.}

	abstract     = {In this article, we report, for the first time, broadband multifunctional metasurfaces with more than four distinct functionalities. The constituent meta-atoms combine two different phase change materials, and in a multi-stage configuration. Finite-difference time-domain simulations demonstrate a broadband reflection amplitude switching between the four states in visible range due to the enhanced cavity length modulation effect from the cascaded Fabry–Perot cavities, overcoming the inherent small optical contrast between the phase change material (PCM) states. This, along with the reflection phase control between the four states, allows us to incorporate both amplitude and phase-dependent properties in the same metasurface — achromatic deflection, wavelength beam splitting, achromatic focusing, and broadband absorption, overcoming the limitations of previous functionality switching mechanisms for the visible band. We have used a Tandem Neural network-based inverse design scheme to ensure the stringent requirements of different states are realized. We have used two forward networks for predicting the reflection amplitude and phase for a meta-atom within the pre-defined design space. The excellent prediction capability of these surrogate models is utilized to train the reverse network. The inverse design network, trained with a labeled data set, is capable of efficiently navigating through the vast parametric space to produce the optimized meta-units given the desired figure-of-merits in terms of reflection amplitude and phase for the four states. The optical characteristics of two inverse-designed metasurfaces have been evaluated as test cases for two different sets of design parameters in the four states. Both structures demonstrate the four desired broadband functionalities while closely matching the design requirements, suggesting their potential in visible-range portable medical imaging devices. The findings of this work will open new horizons for active metasurface design with broadband complex multifunctionalities in different spectral bands.}

Researchers are exploring a 2 {\mu}m waveband for its higher capacity and low attenuation as a solution for the next generation communication technologies. Accordingly, here we report an optically engineered metasurface for this waveband for fiber coupling or lensing. The structure is polarization-insensitive and dynamically tunable between its reflective (OFF) and transmissive (ON) modes. For tunability, we incorporate a novel phase change material In3SbTe2 (IST) for its faster, non-volatile, and reversible metallic-to-insulator phase transition. The integration of indium tin oxide (ITO) as a micro-heater to electrically modulate the light by altering the phase of IST provides the device with additional functionality for point-of-care applications. Using the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) technique, we have achieved a modulation depth of 90\%. The focusing efficiency is as high as 76\% and the ON-OFF switching ratio of the optimized lens is 26 dB. The multilayer insertion of thin IST ensures uniform phase transition with switching energy as low as 232.98 nJ/{\mu}m^2. Thus, with remarkable performance at 2 {\mu}m and dynamic multifunctionality, our proposed device will revolutionize the upcoming telecommunication technologies and beyond.}
