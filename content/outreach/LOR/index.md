### Foreword
Letter of recommendation is a necessity to advance in your career. It brings me utmost joy to see our students succeed in life, and is always a pleasure to give recommendation letter to potential applicants for job or higher studies. 

Please remember that I can only address your accomplishments that <span style="color:red">I was actively involved in</span>. Ask yourself if I would be the right person to judge your research aptitude and skills. I will try to give an **honest** and **impartial** assessment, so also ask yourself if my recommendation would **help** or **hurt** your chances of succeeding.

Note: <span style="color:red">If you enrolled in Masters in BUET, and have dropped out / have F grades in courses, that will also be mentioned in your LOR.</span> We have to comment about the motivation of the student, so you can guess what the response of that question will be in such a case. 


### <a id="criteria"></a> Criteria for Getting Recommendation
you <span style="color:red">MUST</span> meet at least one of the following descriptions/criteria before you try to make an appointment with me for recommendation request.

  1. You performed MSc/PhD research work under my supervision
  2. Final year thesis/project completed under my supervision
  3. Performed some kind of project work under my guidance/in collaboration that resulted in a peer-reveiewed publication 
  4. You successfully completed my graduate level course
  5. You are a colleague / part-time faculty member who directly took any class with me
  6. I taught a final-year lab course that you successfully completed, and demonstrated a honours project <sup>1</sup>
  7. I served as a  member in your MSc/PhD examination committee
  8. I was an external examiner of your Final year thesis/project


 ** for serial number 6 and above, I will only give LORs to schools that have application deadline on or AFTER December 15th of the calendar year. Kindly refrain from requesting LORs for other schools**   

<sup>1</sup> based on  sessional course project alone, it is diffcult to judge your motivation. However,  if a project from a theory/lab course was truly exceptional, and resulted in a publication with my approval, I will be happy to recommend you based on your capacity to perform original research/review. Only for final-year lab-course, if I was directly assigned to your section, AND you completed an honours project successfully in that course, I can recommend you based on your output and ability to solve complex Engineering Problem.  

Simply taking an undergraduate theory course does not give the instructor sufficient capacity to judge the research aptitude of a student. As such, if you only interacted with me as a student in my theory course, unfortunately, I will not be in a position to recommend you. 
 
If you are currently enrolled in BUET MSc program under my supervision, please consult with me before applying. Also, consider not adding me as a recommender if your research progress is unsatisfactory. For students enrolled under other faculty members, I will only recommend you only if your current supervisor recommends. You should attach a copy of the consent in the email, otherwise I will have to personally call and confirm with him/her before giving the LOR.

#### Sample question and answer that I need to do for a LOR
Each Letter of Recommendation form is different, and many a times, I have to manually type out responses, in addition to the formatted LOR that needs to be submitted. Almost all programs require likeart charts. Here is an example of a school's LOR. I am expected to judge each student, whether they fall under the Categories: Outstanding (Top 2%), Very Good (Top 10%), Good
(Top 25%), Average (Top 50%), Below Average (Lower 50%), Not Applicable or Not Known
* Overall scholarly ability
* Technical ability in the field
* Potential as a researcher
* Potential as a teacher
* Intellectual ability/capacity
* Analytical and problem-solving ability
* Quantitative skills
* Meticulousness/attention to detail
* Thoroughness in completing tasks
* Oral communication skills
* Written communication skills
* Listening skills
* Interpersonal skills
* Maturity/emotional intelligence
* Judgment/common sense
* Ability to work well with others
* Motivation
* Initiative
* Perseverance
* Creativity/originality
* Self-reliance and independence in scholarly work
* Flexibility
* Leadership potential
* Self-confidence
* Responsibility
* Integrity
* Work ethic
* Respect for authority
* Time management skills
* Ability to work under pressure



 #### List of Eligible Students
 For convenience, I am explicitly listing students who only did my only undergraduate class and would be eligible for LOR. Other students are requested not to send me an email. 

 * 16 Batch - EEE 416 A1 & A2 (Student ID 001-065)
 * 17 Batch - EEE 416 A1 & A2 (Student ID 001-065)
 * 18 Batch - EEE 416 A2 (Student ID 033-065)
 * 19 Batch - 151-180 (advisee), EEE 416 (Student ID 001-33, 131-163)

### Limit of LOR Request

For my direct thesis students (undergraduate, Masters or PhD) there is no upper limit to giving LORs. For other cases, the number of LOR will be limited to 5. 

### Waiver of Access
In order to receive a LOR from me, you **must Waive the right to access** to what I write. If you do not waive your access, I would also **decline** to recommend you. I believe you should only get my recommendation if you trust my judgement sufficiently. I will, however, tell you in person, if I cannot give you a positive recommendation.

If I find that the waiver is not done in an LOR form, I will copy paste the following text in the LOR form:

<span style="color:red">
"The detailed policy of my LOR is elaborated in my website https://sajid.buet.ac.bd/outreach/LOR, and the candidate still chose the option of not waiving the right to access this report. 
</span>

<span style="color:red">
Since the applicant did not waive the right to access this report, I hereby decline to give a Letter of Recommendation. "
</span>

### Steps to Get LOR:

1. Firstly go above to [Criteria for Getting Recommendation](#criteria) to check if you are eligible to get a LOR from me. If not I might not respond to your email, or just decline to recommend you.

1. Once I give you consent to give LOR by replying to your email, you may put my official email address sajid(at)eee.buet.ac.bd in the application portal.

2. For convenience, please submit the LOR request of ALL the universities at once. It is much easier for me to finish the LOR submission process in one sitting. 

3. If I forget to submit the LOR, please send me an email reminder 1 day before the deadline.
