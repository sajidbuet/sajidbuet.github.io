2023 is probably the year of Artificial Intelligence. Though AI was working in the background to imrpove search suggestions and images, ChatGPT truly showed us the power of AI and how it can reshape our future. Though the sinister undertone of getting replaced by AI, or the possibility of making human race dumber looms in the horizon, AI is here to stay. Probably library work, critical thinking, research, manuscript writing - everything will be delegated to AI in the future, and academia will drastically shrink. Those who remain in the academia must adapt to use the AI tools of the future. Here is a nice list of AI tools especially for an academic (Courtesy [Dr. Mustaq Bilal](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD). It is difficult to say how many of the tools will survive once the AI bubble bursts and we start to see more giant AI companies absorbing and acquiring the small ones. I wish more decentralized and stand alone AI apps were available.
