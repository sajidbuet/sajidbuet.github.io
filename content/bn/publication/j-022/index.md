abstract: The conventional fiber communication band of 1.55 $μ$m is reaching its limit
  attributable to the escalation in bandwidth requirements for high-speed and bulk
  data transmission. Researchers are exploring a 2 $μ$m waveband for its higher capacity
  and low attenuation as a solution for the next generation communication technologies.
  Accordingly, here we report an optically engineered metasurface for this waveband
  for fiber coupling or lensing. The structure is polarization-insensitive and dynamically
  tunable between its reflective (OFF) and transmissive (ON) modes. For tunability,
  we incorporate a novel phase change material In3SbTe2 (IST) for its faster, non-volatile,
  and reversible metallic-to-insulator phase transition. The integration of indium
  tin oxide (ITO) as a micro-heater to electrically modulate the light by altering
  the phase of IST provides the device with additional functionality for point-of-care
  applications. Using the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) technique, we have
  achieved a modulation depth of 90%. The focusing efficiency is as high as 76% and
  the ON-OFF switching ratio of the optimized lens is 26 dB. The multilayer insertion
  of thin IST ensures uniform phase transition with switching energy as low as 232.98
  nJ/$μ$m^2. Thus, with remarkable performance at 2 $μ$m and dynamic multifunctionality,
  our proposed device will revolutionize the upcoming telecommunication technologies
  and beyond.
