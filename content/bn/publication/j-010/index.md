abstract: Refractive‑index (RI) sensing helps to identify biomolecules and chemicals
  in the mid‑infrared range for drug discovery, bioengineering, and environmental
  monitoring. In this paper, we numerically demonstrate an electrically tunable RI
  sensor with ultrahigh sensitivity using a three‑layer graphene nanoribbon array
  separated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Unlike the weak resonance in single‑layer
  graphene nanoribbons, a much stronger plasmon resonance featuring a higher quality
  factor can be excited in the graphene/hBN few‑layer ribbon array. Simultaneously,
  the high purity of graphene on hBN results in an outstanding charge mobility above
  at $300,mathrmK$, which allows a larger modulation depth. The interaction between
  the locally enhanced field around the graphene ribbons and the surrounding analyte
  leads to ultrahigh sensitivity ($4.207,μmathrmm/RIU$), with the figure of merit
  reaching approximately 58. Moreover, this ultrasensitive detector could selectively
  operate in different wavebands by controlling the gate voltage applied to graphene.
  These merits of ultrahigh sensitivity and electrical tunability are major advances
  compared to previous RI sensors, paving the way toward ultrasensitive detection
  using graphene/hBN few‑layer devices.
