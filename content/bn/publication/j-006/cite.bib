 abstract = {Bound hybrid plasmon-polariton modes supported by waveguides, which are formed by gold coating of ridges etched into a silica substrate, are analyzed using numerical simulations and investigated experimentally using near-field microscopy at telecom wavelengths (1425â€“1625 nm). Drastic modifications of the fundamental mode profile along with changes in the mode confinement and propagation loss are found when varying the ridge height. The main mode characteristics (effective mode index, propagation length, and mode profile) are determined from the experimental amplitude- and phase-resolved near-field images and compared with the simulations. The possibility of strongly influencing the mode properties along with subwavelength confinement found simultaneously with relatively long propagation can further be exploited in mode shaping and sensing applications.},
