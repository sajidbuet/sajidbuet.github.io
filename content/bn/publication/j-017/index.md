abstract: In this study, we present an all-optical reflection modulator for 2textmu
  m communication band exploiting a nano-gear-array metasurface and a phase-change-material
  Getextsubscript2Sbtextsubscript2Tetextsubscript5 (GST). The reflectance of the structure
  can be manipulated by altering the phase of GST by employing optical stimuli. The
  paper shows details on the optical and opto-thermal modeling techniques of GST.
  Numerical investigation reveals that the metastructure exhibits a conspicuous changeover
  from $∼$ 99% absorption to very poor interaction with the operating light depending
  on the switching states of the GST, ending up with 85% modulation depth and only
  0.58 dB insertion loss. Due to noticeable differences in optical responses, we can
  demonstrate a high extinction ratio of 28 dB and a commendable FOM of 49, so far
  the best modulation performance in this wavelength window. In addition, real-time
  tracking of the reflectance during phase transition manifests high-speed switching
  expending low energy per cycle, on the order of sub-nJ. Hence, given its overall
  performance, the device will be a paradigm for the optical modulators for upcoming
  2textmu m communication technology.
