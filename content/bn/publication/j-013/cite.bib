 abstract = {We present a gear-shaped plasmonic nano-structure with structural tunability and high RI sensitivity. New tunable geometric parameters of the gear-tooth give further flexibility for design. By using FDTD method, the reflection spectrum of the structure is theoretically analyzed with analyte RI in the range of 1.0 to 1.44. The best achieved sensitivity is- 1044 nm/RIU for our proposed structure. The resonance wavelength of the structure is independent of the polarization angle for large number of teeth. The structure can be used to design tunable sensors for biomedical and chemical applications.},
