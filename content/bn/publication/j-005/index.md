abstract: Conventional plasmonic materials, namely, noble metals, hamper the realization
  of practical plasmonic devices due to their intrinsic limitations, such as lack
  of capabilities to tune in real time their optical properties, failure to assimilate
  with CMOS standards, and severe degradation at increased temperatures. Transparent
  conducting oxide (TCO) is a promising alternative plasmonic material throughout
  the near‑ and mid‑infrared wavelengths. In addition to compatibility with established
  silicon‑based fabrication procedures, TCOs provide great flexibility in the design
  and optimization of plasmonic devices because their intrinsic optical properties
  can be tailored and dynamically tuned. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate
  metal‑oxide metasurfaces operating as quarter‑wave plates (QWPs) over a broad near‑infrared
  (NIR) range from $1.75$--$2.5,μmathrmm$. We employ zinc oxide highly doped with
  gallium (Ga:ZnO) as the plasmonic constituent material of the metasurfaces and fabricate
  arrays of orthogonal nanorod pairs. Our Ga:ZnO metasurfaces provide a high degree
  of circular polarization across two distinct optical bands in the NIR. Flexible
  broadband tunability of the QWP metasurfaces is achieved by significant shifts of
  their optical bands.
