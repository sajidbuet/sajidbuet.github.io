abstract: Researchers have shown considerable interest in two-dimensional silicon
  carbide recently because of its relatively high exciton binding energy and wide
  bandgap. This article focuses on analyzing and studying first-principles density
  functional theory to assess the influence of strain on the phonon, mechanical, optical,
  and electronic characteristics of SiC. Additionally, we investigate the band structure
  for spin-orbit coupling. The SiC exhibits an indirect bandgap, but applying tensile
  strain it shows a direct bandgap. Although the bandgap decreases under tensile stresses
  and the SOC effect, it increases when exposed to compressive pressures. Furthermore,
  the optical characteristics of single-layer SiC, such as the refractive index, electron
  energy loss spectra, dielectric spectra, and absorption coefficient, showcase its
  remarkable capacity to effectively absorb light in both the visible and infrared
  (IR) regions. SiC exhibits dynamic and mechanical stability under compressive strain
  up to 3% and under tensile strain up to +6.
