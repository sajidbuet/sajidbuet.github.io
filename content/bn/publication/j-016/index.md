abstract: 'In this paper, we have presented a novel plasmonic Refractive Index (RI)
  sensing scheme based on a rewritable optical disc structure with customized dimer-like
  nanopatterns. We have performed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation
  for this work to exhibit the optical resonant response and sensing performance of
  our proposed sensing platform. We have also investigated how the changes in the
  different structural parameters affect the resonant wavelength. The high refractive
  index sensitivity of 768nm/RIU allowed our sensing system to achieve a resolution
  limit for blood Hemoglobin(Hb) detection superior to most Hb sensors previously
  reported. The use of the built-in grating structure of the optical disc, the ability
  to create customized patterns, and the high resolution achieved in blood Hb detection
  suggest the potential of our proposed RI sensor as a cost-efficient, reliable sensing
  technology for medical applications. '
