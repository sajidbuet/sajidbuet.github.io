 abstract = {Biomimicry has been utilized in many branches of science and engineering to develop devices for enhanced and better performance. The application of nanotechnology has made life easier in modern times. It has offered a way to manipulate matter and systems at the atomic level. As a result, the miniaturization of numerous devices has been possible. Of late, the integration of biomimicry with nanotechnology has shown promising results in the fields of medicine, robotics, sensors, photonics, etc. Biomimicry in nanotechnology has provided eco-friendly and green solutions to the energy problem and in textiles. This is a new research area that needs to be explored more thoroughly. This review illustrates the progress and innovations made in the field of nanotechnology with the integration of biomimicry.},
