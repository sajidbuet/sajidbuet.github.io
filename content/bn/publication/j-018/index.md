abstract: Biomimicry has been utilized in many branches of science and engineering
  to develop devices for enhanced and better performance. The application of nanotechnology
  has made life easier in modern times. It has offered a way to manipulate matter
  and systems at the atomic level. As a result, the miniaturization of numerous devices
  has been possible. Of late, the integration of biomimicry with nanotechnology has
  shown promising results in the fields of medicine, robotics, sensors, photonics,
  etc. Biomimicry in nanotechnology has provided eco-friendly and green solutions
  to the energy problem and in textiles. This is a new research area that needs to
  be explored more thoroughly. This review illustrates the progress and innovations
  made in the field of nanotechnology with the integration of biomimicry.
