Not true subscripts, but can help for emphasis when you cannot use LaTeX/MathJax:
- combining low line: ̲  (U+0332)

If you need full math-quality subscripts for arbitrary text, prefer LaTeX/MathJax (e.g., `x_{n+1}`).

## 16. Notes for Markdown users

- Prefer the true minus **−** over hyphen **-** in equations.
- Some symbols (blackboard-bold sets, multiple integrals) depend heavily on font support.
- If you need exact spacing and typography, use LaTeX/MathJax instead of raw Unicode.
