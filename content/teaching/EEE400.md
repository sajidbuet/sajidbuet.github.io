###  Course Content (As approved by the Academic Council)

The students will perform experimental and/or theoretical investigation of a research topic related to electrical and electronic engineering discipline Students will attend seminars, review research literature and related contemporary aspects of the topic, identify problem, formulate a proposal to solve a specific problem related to the topic, interpret data, and analyze the problem using first principles of mathematical, natural or engineering sciences. Students will conduct investigations of the problem using research-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of information to provide valid conclusions. Students will understand and adhere to professional ethics and ethical principles of research. The students will be required to present a progress report at the end of the first semester, and present and submit a thesis at the end of the work.

### Mandatory Final Thesis Submission
As per BUGS decision (BUGS Meeting No 11/2023), as a mandatory requirement for graduation, students must submit a hard copy thesis, in approved template, duly signed by their respective supervisors, to the Faculty of EEE library, and submit the acknowledgement slip from the library to their respective advisors. Respective advisors will only forward the application of graduation after the receipt of the acknowledgement slip. Faculty of EEE library will store the thesis for at least 3 years. Such hard copy of thesis will not be publicly uploaded into the website.

### Thesis Template and Format
