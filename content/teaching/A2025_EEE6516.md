**This webpage will not be updated, and kept just for prospective students to have an idea about the course.**  
We have created a class Teams for this course, if you have not been added to the class Team, please email the course instructor.

## Incomplete Grade Policy
In this course, you will be given an I grade, ONLY if you complete all assignments and Final Presentation, and just fail to appear in the final exam due to reasons beyond your control. You must apply to Head of the Department of EEE within 1 week of commencement of the final exam. 
Failure to participate either the assignments or final-presentation would not be considered for I grade, and your grading would be done through the Grading criteria. 
Kindly consider the policy, and withdraw from the course if you are unsure if you would continue.

## Class Schedule
Wednesday 2pm-5pm
Room EEE 625, ECE Building, BUET

## Syllabus
### Course Content
Introduction to quantum computing; Postulates of quantum mechanics; Qubits and single-qubit gates; Operators and quantum measurement; Quantum information processing, superposition, entanglement, no cloning theorem, and quantum teleportation; Quantum circuits, controlled operation and measurement, universal quantum gates; Quantum algorithms: Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Grover’s algorithm, Shor’s algorithm, quantum Fourier transform and phase estimation; Density matrices and Bloch sphere representation of quantum variables; Quantum 
error correction and fault-tolerant architecture; Physical realization of quantum computers: harmonic oscillator, optical quantum computers, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and new implementation schemes.
