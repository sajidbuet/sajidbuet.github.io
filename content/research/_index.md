      - title: 'Photonic Systems'
        content: 'We explore nanophotonics, which enables light control at the nanoscale for compact, energy-efficient devices. Surface plasmon resonances in metals can concentrate light into subwavelength volumes-critical for ultra-sensitive biosensing and nanoscale light-matter interaction. Metasurfaces is a planar nanostructured material that precisely control the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light. Our research focuses on designing, fabricating, and characterizing these advanced photonic platforms using cutting-edge nanofabrication and simulation tools.'

      - title: 'Antennas'
        content: 'Historically, we studied reflector designs, patch antenna for power efficiency and radiation pattern optimization. Satellite dishes offer high-gain communication links for remote sensing and deep-space communication. Patch antennas are low-profile, planar devices ideal for compact wireless systems and wearable electronics. Horn antennas, known for their high directivity and stability, are key in test ranges and microwave systems. We explored novel materials and miniaturization techniques to enhance bandwidth and polarization control.'
