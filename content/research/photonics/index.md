        We explore nanophotonics, which enables light control at the nanoscale for compact, energy-efficient devices. Surface plasmon resonances in metals can concentrate light into subwavelength volumes-critical for ultra-sensitive biosensing and nanoscale light-matter interaction. Metasurfaces is a planar nanostructured material that precisely control the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light. Our research focuses on designing, fabricating, and characterizing these advanced photonic platforms using cutting-edge nanofabrication and simulation tools.
