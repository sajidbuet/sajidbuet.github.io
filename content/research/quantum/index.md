        Quantum technologies are at the forefront of next-generation innovation, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionize information processing and communication. Our work aims to develop robust and scalable quantum networks. Quantum photonics combines light and quantum mechanics to enable on-chip quantum circuits, essential for quantum information processing. We investigate components for integrated quantum photonic platforms, quantum communication protocols.
