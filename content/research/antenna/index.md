        Historically, we studied reflector designs, patch antenna for power efficiency and radiation pattern optimization. Satellite dishes offer high-gain communication links for remote sensing and deep-space communication. Patch antennas are low-profile, planar devices ideal for compact wireless systems and wearable electronics. Horn antennas, known for their high directivity and stability, are key in test ranges and microwave systems. We explored novel materials and miniaturization techniques to enhance bandwidth and polarization control.
