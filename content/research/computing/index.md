        The field of computer architecture underpins the performance and efficiency of all modern computing systemsâ€”from smartphones to supercomputers. Our research explores how to design processors that are faster, more energy-efficient, and capable of handling the demands of AI, scientific computing, and large-scale data analytics. We study microarchitecture components such as instruction pipelines, memory hierarchies, branch predictors, and multicore processors.
