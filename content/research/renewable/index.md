        We investigate solar cells, the core components that convert sunlight into electricity, aiming to improve their efficiency through novel materials and fabrication techniques. At the system level, we study solar panels, optimizing layout, orientation, and thermal management to enhance power output. Beyond generation, our research extends to grid optimization, ensuring stable integration of renewables into existing power infrastructures. We explore smart grid architectures, energy storage strategies, and predictive control algorithms to balance supply and demand.
