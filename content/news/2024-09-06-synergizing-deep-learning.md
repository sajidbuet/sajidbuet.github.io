title: Synergizing Deep Learning and Phase Change Materials for Multifunctional Metasurfaces
---

A new study, "Synergizing Deep Learning and Phase Change Materials for Four-State Broadband Multifunctional Metasurfaces in the Visible Range," has been published in the Journal of Optics and Laser Technology. The research integrates deep learning algorithms with phase change materials to design metasurfaces capable of multiple functionalities across the visible spectrum. This approach could lead to the development of advanced optical devices with applications in imaging, sensing, and display technologies.
