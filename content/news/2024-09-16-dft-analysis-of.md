title: DFT Analysis of Strain Effects on Monolayer Silicon Carbide Published
---

A recent publication in Physica B: Condensed Matter presents a density functional theory (DFT) analysis titled "Investigation of the Physical Properties through Strain Effect of Monolayer Silicon Carbide Material." The study examines how strain influences the mechanical and electronic properties of monolayer silicon carbide (SiC), revealing potential applications in nanoscale devices. Understanding these strain effects is crucial for designing SiC-based components in flexible electronics and sensors.
