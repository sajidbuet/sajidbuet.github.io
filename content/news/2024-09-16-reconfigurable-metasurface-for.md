title: Reconfigurable Metasurface for Quantum Emitter Control Published
---

Researchers have published a paper titled "Sb₂S₃/AlGaAs-Based Reconfigurable Metasurface for Dynamic Polarization and Directionality Control of Quantum Emitter Emission" in RSC Advances. The study demonstrates a metasurface that can dynamically control the polarization and directionality of light emitted from quantum sources. This innovation holds promise for quantum communication technologies, where precise manipulation of light is essential for information transfer and processing.
