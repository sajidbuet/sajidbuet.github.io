 abstract = {Due to changes in our climate and constant loss of habitat for animals, new pathogens for humans are constantly erupting. SARS-CoV-2 virus, become so infectious and deadly that they put new challenge to the whole technological advancement of healthcare. Within this very decade, several other deadly virus outbreaks were witnessed by humans such as Zika virus, Ebola virus, MERS-coronavirus etc and there might be even more infectious and deadlier diseases in the horizon. Though conventional techniques have succeeded in detecting these viruses to some extent, these techniques are time-consuming, costly, and require trained human-resources. Plasmonic metamaterial based biosensors might pave the way to  low-cost rapid virus detection. So this review discusses in details, the latest development in plasmonics and metamaterial based biosensors for virus, viral particles and antigen detection and the future direction of research in this field.  },
