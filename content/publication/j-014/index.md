abstract: 'Due to changes in our climate and constant loss of habitat for animals,
  new pathogens for humans are constantly erupting. SARS-CoV-2 virus, become so infectious
  and deadly that they put new challenge to the whole technological advancement of
  healthcare. Within this very decade, several other deadly virus outbreaks were witnessed
  by humans such as Zika virus, Ebola virus, MERS-coronavirus etc and there might
  be even more infectious and deadlier diseases in the horizon. Though conventional
  techniques have succeeded in detecting these viruses to some extent, these techniques
  are time-consuming, costly, and require trained human-resources. Plasmonic metamaterial
  based biosensors might pave the way to  low-cost rapid virus detection. So this
  review discusses in details, the latest development in plasmonics and metamaterial
  based biosensors for virus, viral particles and antigen detection and the future
  direction of research in this field.  '
