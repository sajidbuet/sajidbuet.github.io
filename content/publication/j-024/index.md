abstract: In this article, we report, for the first time, broadband multifunctional
  metasurfaces with more than four distinct functionalities. The constituent meta-atoms
  combine two different phase change materials,  and  in a multi-stage configuration.
  Finite-difference time-domain simulations demonstrate a broadband reflection amplitude
  switching between the four states in visible range due to the enhanced cavity length
  modulation effect from the cascaded Fabry–Perot cavities, overcoming the inherent
  small optical contrast between the phase change material (PCM) states. This, along
  with the reflection phase control between the four states, allows us to incorporate
  both amplitude and phase-dependent properties in the same metasurface — achromatic
  deflection, wavelength beam splitting, achromatic focusing, and broadband absorption,
  overcoming the limitations of previous functionality switching mechanisms for the
  visible band. We have used a Tandem Neural network-based inverse design scheme to
  ensure the stringent requirements of different states are realized. We have used
  two forward networks for predicting the reflection amplitude and phase for a meta-atom
  within the pre-defined design space. The excellent prediction capability of these
  surrogate models is utilized to train the reverse network. The inverse design network,
  trained with a labeled data set, is capable of efficiently navigating through the
  vast parametric space to produce the optimized meta-units given the desired figure-of-merits
  in terms of reflection amplitude and phase for the four states. The optical characteristics
  of two inverse-designed metasurfaces have been evaluated as test cases for two different
  sets of design parameters in the four states. Both structures demonstrate the four
  desired broadband functionalities while closely matching the design requirements,
  suggesting their potential in visible-range portable medical imaging devices. The
  findings of this work will open new horizons for active metasurface design with
  broadband complex multifunctionalities in different spectral bands.
