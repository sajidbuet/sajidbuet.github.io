abstract: The hybrid metal-dielectric nanostructures (HMDN) are promising candidates
  to address the ohmic loss by conventional nanostructures in photovoltaic applications
  by strong confinement and high scattering directivity. In this study, we present
  a c-ȩSi/ŢiO2 heterojunction thin film solar cell (TFSC) where a pair of triangular
  HMDN comprised of cģ and ceO̧ was utilized to enhance the longer wavelength light
  absorption. The presence of the ceT2̧ inverted pyramid layer, in combination with
  the ceITa̧nd ceSiOb̧ased pyramid layers at the front, enhanced the shorter wavelength
  light absorption by increasing the optical path and facilitating the coupling of
  incoming light in photonic mode. Consequently, the average absorption by 1000 nm
  thick photoactive layer reached 83.32 % for AM 1.5G within the wavelength range
  of 300 – 1100 nm which was investigated by employing the finite-difference time-domain
  (FDTD) method.  The electric field profile and current density profile demonstrated
  the respective contributions of each layer in the absorption of light at shorter
  and longer wavelengths. The structure exhibited a short circuit current density
  ($J_sc$) of 37.96 mA/cm$^2$ and a power conversion efficiency ($PCE$) of 17.42 %.
  The efficiency of our proposed structure experienced a maximum relative change of
  0.34 % when a polarized light was exposed with an angle of 0$^∘$ to 90$^∘$. The
  incorporation of self-heating in non-isothermal conditions reduced $PCE$ by 13.77
  %.  In addition, the comparative analysis to assess the impact of HMDN on our structure
  revealed a 4.54 % increase in $PCE$ of the structure with metallic nanostructures,
  paving the way for the utilization of HMDN to enhance the performance of TFSC.
