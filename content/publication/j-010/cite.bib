 abstract = {Refractive‑index (RI) sensing helps to identify biomolecules and chemicals in the mid‑infrared range for drug discovery, bioengineering, and environmental monitoring. In this paper, we numerically demonstrate an electrically tunable RI sensor with ultrahigh sensitivity using a three‑layer graphene nanoribbon array separated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Unlike the weak resonance in single‑layer graphene nanoribbons, a much stronger plasmon resonance featuring a higher quality factor can be excited in the graphene/hBN few‑layer ribbon array. Simultaneously, the high purity of graphene on hBN results in an outstanding charge mobility above at $300\,\mathrmK$, which allows a larger modulation depth. The interaction between the locally enhanced field around the graphene ribbons and the surrounding analyte leads to ultrahigh sensitivity ($4.207\,μ\mathrmm/RIU$), with the figure of merit reaching approximately 58. Moreover, this ultrasensitive detector could selectively operate in different wavebands by controlling the gate voltage applied to graphene. These merits of ultrahigh sensitivity and electrical tunability are major advances compared to previous RI sensors, paving the way toward ultrasensitive detection using graphene/hBN few‑layer devices.},
