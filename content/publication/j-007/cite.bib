 abstract = {This study demonstrates visible color hologram using a plasmonic metasurface. The metasurface is fabricated by perforating nanoslits in a 50 nm thick monocrystalline silver film that is ultrasmooth and has ultralow loss compared to conventional polycrystalline silver films commonly used in plasmonics. The designed plasmonic hologram is the thinnest metasurface hologram operating in transmission mode to the best of our knowledge. Holograms of three individual component colors (red, green, and blue) are demonstrated in transmission mode, and a scheme for generating polychromatic hologram is illustrated. By adjusting the slit dimensions and orientation, the phase of a visible spectrum light can be controlled, paving the way to applications of ultracompact polychromatic plasmonic metasurfaces for advanced light manipulation.},
