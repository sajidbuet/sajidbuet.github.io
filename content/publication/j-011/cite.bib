 abstract = {Active control over the flow of light is highly desirable because of its applicability to information processing, telecommunication, and spectroscopic imaging. In this paper, by employing the tunability of carrier density in a $1\,\mathrmnm$ titanium nitride (TiN) film, we numerically demonstrate deep phase modulation (PM) in an electrically tunable gold‑strip/TiN‑film hybrid metasurface. A $337^∘$ PM is achieved at $1.550\,μ\mathrmm$ with a $3%$ carrier‑density change in the TiN film.},
