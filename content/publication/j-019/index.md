abstract: 'In this article, we report, as per our knowledge, for the first time phase
  change material (PCM) based reconfigurable metasurfaces for tailoring different
  degrees of freedom (DoF) of the quantum emitter (QE) emission, namely polarization
  and directionality, two key controlling factors in applications like quantum computing,
  communication, and chiral optics. We have used the hybrid plasmon-QE coupled bullseye
  grating system as the basic building block of the structures. Carefully engineered
  azimuthal width profile of the $mathrmSb_2S_3$/AlGaAs ridge and selectively controlled
  transition of PCM state provide dynamic control over amplitude and phase of the
  scattered radiation. Based on this methodology, we have designed five different
  metasurfaces for on-demand switching of target DoFs of QE emission, ensuring high
  collection efficiency due to the near-field coupling scheme. The first two metasurfaces
  switch the majority of the out-going radiation from radially polarized to circularly
  polarized, whereas the next two switch the direction of circularly polarized out-going
  radiation by a maximum of 9.23$mathrm^o$ while maintaining the spin state (or polarization
  chirality) in the simulation environment. The third metasurface is capable of on-demand
  generation and separation of opposite spin states of out-going radiation by 11.48$mathrm^o$
  utilizing the selectively controlled phase transition of $mathrmSb_2S_3$. Such reconfigurable
  multi-dimensional manipulation of QE radiation has not been investigated previously.
  This work proves the vast potential of active metasurfaces to modify the DoFs of
  QE emission, paving the way for high-dimensional quantum sources for high-speed
  quantum communication, higher dimensional quantum processing, and switchable chiral
  optics. '
