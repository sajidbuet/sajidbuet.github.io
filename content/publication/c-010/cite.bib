 abstract = {A metal/dielectric multilayered metasurface can be used to engineer the plasma frequency by controlling the ratio between the metal and dielectric layers. In this work, we demonstrate that a multilayered nanodisk metasurface based on semiconductor materials offers the design flexibility for tuning the plasmonic resonance.},
