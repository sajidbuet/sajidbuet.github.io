abstract: Metasurfaces are thin two-dimensional metamaterial layers that allow or
  inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves in desired directions. For example,
  metasurfaces have been demonstrated to produce unusual scattering properties of
  incident plane waves or to guide and modulate surface waves to obtain desired radiation
  properties. These properties have been employed, for example, to create innovative
  wireless receivers and transmitters. In addition, metasurfaces have recently been
  proposed to confine electromagnetic waves, thereby avoiding undesired leakage of
  energy and increasing the overall efficiency of electromagnetic instruments and
  devices. The main advantages of metasurfaces with respect to the existing conventional
  technology include their low cost, low level of absorption in comparison with bulky
  metamaterials, and easy integration due to their thin profile. Due to these advantages,
  they are promising candidates for real-world solutions to overcome the challenges
  posed by the next generation of transmitters and receivers of future high-rate communication
  systems that require highly precise and efficient antennas, sensors, active components,
  filters, and integrated technologies. This Roadmap is aimed at binding together
  the experiences of prominent researchers in the field of metasurfaces, from which
  explanations for the physics behind the extraordinary properties of these structures
  shall be provided from viewpoints of diverse theoretical backgrounds. Other goals
  of this endeavour are to underline the advantages and limitations of metasurfaces,
  as well as to lay out guidelines for their use in present and future electromagnetic
  devices.
