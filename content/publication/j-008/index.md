abstract: Optical metasurfaces are judicously engineered electromagnetic interfaces
  that can control and manipulate many of lightâ€™s quintessential properties, such
  as amplitude, phase, and polarization. These artificial surfaces are composed of
  subwavelength arrays of optical antennas that experience resonant light-matter interaction
  with incoming electromagnetic radiation. Their ability to arbitrarily engineer optical
  interactions has generated considerable excitement and interest in recent years
  and is a promising methodology for miniaturizing optical components for applications
  in optical communication systems, imaging, sensing, and optical manipulation. However,
  development of optical metasurfaces requires progress and solutions to inherent
  challenges, namely large losses often associated with the resonant structures; large-scale,
  complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible nanofabrication techniques; and
  incorporation of active control elements. Furthermore, practical metasurface devices
  require robust operation in high-temperature environments, caustic chemicals, and
  intense electromagnetic fields. Although these challenges  are substantial, optical
  metasurfaces remain in their infancy, and novel material platforms that offer resilient,
  low-loss, and tunable metasurface designs are driving new and promising routes for
  overcoming these hurdles. In this review, we discuss the different material platforms
  in the literature for various applications of metasurfaces, including refractory
  plasmonic materials, epitaxial noble  metal, silicon, graphene, phase change materials,
  and metal oxides. We identify the key advantages of each material platform and review
  the breakthrough devices that were made possible with each material. Finally, we
  provide an outlook for emerging metasurface devices and  the new material platforms
  that are enabling such devices
