abstract: Since ancient times, plasmonic structural coloring has inspired humanity;
  glassmakers achieved vibrant colors by doping glass with metal nanoparticles to
  craft beautiful objects such as the Roman Lycurgus cup and stained glass. These
  lovely color filtering effects are a consequence of the resonant coupling of light
  and free electrons in metal nanoparticles, known as surface plasmons. Thanks to
  the continuing improvement of nanofabrication technology, the dimensions of nanoparticles
  and structures can now be precisely engineered to form “optical nanoantennas,” allowing
  for control of optical response at an unprecedented level. Recently, the field of
  plasmonic structural coloring has seen extensive growth. In this review, we provide
  an up-to-date overview of various plasmonic color filtering approaches and highlight
  their uses in a broad palette of applications. Various surface plasmon resonance
  modes employed in the plasmonic color filtering effect are discussed. We first review
  the development of the pioneering static plasmonic colors achieved with invariant
  optical nanoantennas and ambient environment, then we address a variety of emerging
  approaches that enable dynamic color tuning, erasing, and restoring. These dynamic
  color filters are capable of actively changing the filtered colors and carrying
  more color information states than the static systems. Thus, they open an avenue
  to high-density data storage, information encryption, and plasmonic information
  processing. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future perspectives in this exciting
  research area.
