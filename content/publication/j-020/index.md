abstract: In this article, we report, as per our knowledge, for the first time phase
  change material (PCM) based reconfigurable metasurfaces for tailoring different
  degrees of freedom (DoF) of the quantum emitter (QE) emission, namely polarization
  and directionality, two key controlling factors in applications like quantum computing,
  communication, and chiral optics. We have used a hybrid plasmon-QE coupled bullseye
  grating system utilizing the unexplored concept of composite nano-antennas in quantum
  photonics as the basic building block of the structures. Carefully engineered azimuthal
  width profile of the $mathrmSb_2S_3$/AlGaAs composite ridge and selectively controlled
  transition of PCM ($mathrmSb_2S_3$) state provide dynamic control over amplitude
  and phase of the scattered radiation. Based on this methodology, we have designed
  five different metasurfaces for on-demand switching of target DoFs of QE emission,
  ensuring high collection efficiency due to the near-field coupling scheme. The first
  two metasurfaces switch the majority of the out-going radiation from radially polarized
  to circularly polarized, whereas the next two switch the direction of circularly
  polarized out-going radiation by a maximum of 9.23$mathrm^o$ while maintaining the
  spin state (or polarization chirality) in the simulation environment. The third
  metasurface category is capable of on-demand generation and separation of opposite
  spin states of out-going radiation by 11.48$mathrm^o$ utilizing the selectively
  controlled phase transition of $mathrmSb_2S_3$. Such reconfigurable multi-dimensional
  manipulation of QE radiation has not been investigated previously. This work proves
  the vast potential of active metasurfaces to modify the DoFs of QE emission, paving
  the way for high-dimensional quantum sources for high-speed quantum communication,
  higher dimensional quantum processing, and switchable chiral optics.
