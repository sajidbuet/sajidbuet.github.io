abstract: We present a gear-shaped plasmonic nano-structure with structural tunability
  and high RI sensitivity. New tunable geometric parameters of the gear-tooth give
  further flexibility for design. By using FDTD method, the reflection spectrum of
  the structure is theoretically analyzed with analyte RI in the range of 1.0 to 1.44.
  The best achieved sensitivity is- 1044 nm/RIU for our proposed structure. The resonance
  wavelength of the structure is independent of the polarization angle for large number
  of teeth. The structure can be used to design tunable sensors for biomedical and
  chemical applications.
