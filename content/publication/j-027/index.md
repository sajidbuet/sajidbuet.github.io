abstract: The advent of graphene catalyzed extensive exploration into two-dimensional
  (2D) materials, owing to their extraordinary electronic, mechanical, and optical
  properties. Among these, two-dimensional silicon carbide (2D-SiC) has emerged as
  a compelling candidate for next-generation optoelectronic devices due to its inherent
  planar structure, robust mechanical strength, high exciton binding energy, high
  thermal stability, and wide band gap. In this work, we present a comprehensive first-principles
  investigation into the effects of intrinsic point defects including vacancies and
  antisites as well as substitutional doping with various single foreign atom (e.g.,
  As, Bi, Ga, Ge, In, P, Pb, Sb, Sn, Te, Ca, K, Mg) on the electronic and optical
  properties of 2D-SiC. Using density functional theory (DFT), we demonstrate that
  the direct band gap of pristine 2D-SiC is preserved in the presence of key defect
  types and dopants, affirming its suitability for efficient light-emitting applications.
  Building upon these findings, we propose a novel light-emitting diode (LED) architecture
  utilizing defect, doping-tailored 2D-SiC as the active emissive layer. Simulated
  optical and electrical performance metrics, including power spectral density, current–voltage
  characteristics, luminous power, light extraction efficiency, and CIE color coordinates,
  confirm the feasibility of achieving high-performance white light emission through
  strategic RGB color mixing. These findings confirm the capabilities of defect and
  dopant-engineered 2D-SiC as a high-performance material platform for adjustable
  light emission within the visible spectrum, which highlights its appropriateness
  for incorporation into cutting-edge optoelectronic devices and solid-state lighting
  applications.
