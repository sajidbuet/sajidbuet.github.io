abstract: Bound hybrid plasmon-polariton modes supported by waveguides, which are
  formed by gold coating of ridges etched into a silica substrate, are analyzed using
  numerical simulations and investigated experimentally using near-field microscopy
  at telecom wavelengths (1425â€“1625 nm). Drastic modifications of the fundamental
  mode profile along with changes in the mode confinement and propagation loss are
  found when varying the ridge height. The main mode characteristics (effective mode
  index, propagation length, and mode profile) are determined from the experimental
  amplitude- and phase-resolved near-field images and compared with the simulations.
  The possibility of strongly influencing the mode properties along with subwavelength
  confinement found simultaneously with relatively long propagation can further be
  exploited in mode shaping and sensing applications.
