abstract: We report a refractive index sensor comprising of unique T grating on top
  of periodic nano-cavities. The sensor has two resonant modes sensitive to different
  regions of the structure with low inter-region interference, hence allows simultaneous
  detection of two different analytes or more accurate detection of a single analyte.
  The sensor also provides a self-referencing feature for a broad range of refractive
  index, from 1.3 to 1.5. Using the FDTD method, the sensitivities of 801.7 nm RIUtextsuperscript-1
  and 1386.8 nm RIUtextsuperscript-1 have been recorded for the two modes respectively.
  The versatility of the structure makes the sensor a prominent candidate for biochemical
  and other sensing applications.
