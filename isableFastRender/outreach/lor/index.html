      <h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>
<p>Letter of recommendation is a necessity to advance in your career. It brings me utmost joy to see our students succeed in life, and is always a pleasure to give recommendation letter to potential applicants for job or higher studies.</p>
<p>Please remember that I can only address your accomplishments that <span style="color:red">I was actively involved in</span>. Ask yourself if I would be the right person to judge your research aptitude and skills. I will try to give an <strong>honest</strong> and <strong>impartial</strong> assessment, so also ask yourself if my recommendation would <strong>help</strong> or <strong>hurt</strong> your chances of succeeding.</p>
<p>Note: <span style="color:red">If you enrolled in Masters in BUET, and have dropped out / have F grades in courses, that will also be mentioned in your LOR.</span> We have to comment about the motivation of the student, so you can guess what the response of that question will be in such a case.</p>
<h3 id="criteria-for-getting-recommendation"><a id="criteria"></a> Criteria for Getting Recommendation</h3>
<p>you <span style="color:red">MUST</span> meet at least one of the following descriptions/criteria before you try to make an appointment with me for recommendation request.</p>
<ol>
<li>You performed MSc/PhD research work under my supervision</li>
<li>Final year thesis/project completed under my supervision</li>
<li>Performed some kind of project work under my guidance/in collaboration that resulted in a peer-reveiewed publication</li>
<li>You successfully completed my graduate level course</li>
<li>You are a colleague / part-time faculty member who directly took any class with me</li>
<li>I taught a final-year lab course that you successfully completed, and demonstrated a good project <sup>1</sup></li>
<li>I served as a  member in your MSc/PhD examination committee</li>
<li>I was an external examiner of your Final year thesis/project</li>
<li>My undergraduate advisee <sup></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>** for serial number 6 and above, I will only give LORs to schools that have application deadline on or AFTER December 15th of the calendar year. Kindly refrain from requesting LORs for other schools**</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> based on  sessional course project alone, it is diffcult to judge your motivation. However,  if a project from a theory/lab course was truly exceptional, and resulted in a publication with my approval, I will be happy to recommend you based on your capacity to perform original research/review. Only for final-year lab-course, if I was directly assigned to your section, AND you completed a project successfully in that course, I can recommend you based on your output and ability to solve complex Engineering Problem.</p>
<p>Simply taking an undergraduate theory course does not give the instructor sufficient capacity to judge the research aptitude of a student. As such, if you only interacted with me as a student in my theory course, unfortunately, I will not be in a position to recommend you.</p>
<p>If you are currently enrolled in BUET MSc program under my supervision, please consult with me before applying. Also, consider not adding me as a recommender if your research progress is unsatisfactory. For students enrolled under other faculty members, I will only recommend you only if your current supervisor recommends. You should attach a copy of the consent in the email, otherwise I will have to personally call and confirm with him/her before giving the LOR.</p>
<h4 id="list-of-eligible-students">List of Eligible Students</h4>
<p>For convenience, I am explicitly listing students who only did my only undergraduate class and would be eligible for LOR. Other students are requested not to send me an email.</p>
<ul>
<li>16 Batch - EEE 416 A1 &amp; A2 (Student ID 001-065)</li>
<li>17 Batch - EEE 416 A1 &amp; A2 (Student ID 001-065)</li>
<li>18 Batch - EEE 416 A2 (Student ID 033-065)</li>
<li>19 Batch - 151-180 (advisee), EEE 416 (Student ID 001-33, 131-163)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limit-of-lor-request">Limit of LOR Request</h3>
<p>For my direct thesis students (undergraduate, Masters or PhD) there is no upper limit to giving LORs. For other cases, the number of LOR will be limited to 5.</p>
<h3 id="waiver-of-access">Waiver of Access</h3>
<p>In order to receive a LOR from me, you <strong>must Waive the right to access</strong> to what I write. If you do not waive your access, I would also <strong>decline</strong> to recommend you. I believe you should only get my recommendation if you trust my judgement sufficiently. I will, however, tell you in person, if I cannot give you a positive recommendation.</p>
<p>If I find that the waiver is not done in an LOR form, I will copy paste the following text in the LOR form:</p>
<span style="color:red">
"The detailed policy of my LOR is elaborated in my website https://sajid.buet.ac.bd/outreach/LOR, and the candidate still chose the option of not waiving the right to access this report. 
</span>
<span style="color:red">
Since the applicant did not waive the right to access this report, I hereby decline to give a Letter of Recommendation. "
</span>
<h3 id="steps-to-get-lor">Steps to Get LOR:</h3>

<h4 id="reply-template-for-ineligible-students">Reply template for ineligible students</h4>
<span style="color:black">
  Dear X, <br/> Thank you very much for your email.

<h4 id="reply-template-for-eligible-students">Reply template for eligible students</h4>
<span style="color:black">
  Dear X, <br/> Thank you very much for your email. If you could kindly go to my website [https://sajid.buet.ac.bd/outreach/LOR](https://sajid.buet.ac.bd/outreach/LOR) and, please fill out the [LOR Request form](https://sajid.buet.ac.bd/downloads/LOR_Request_Form.docx) and send me the email again.

  <br/> Once you finish submitting all LORs, kindly email and let me know, again, and I will try to submit all of your LORs in one go. You do not need to send me a draft LOR, just the form is sufficient.
  <br/> For students enrolled under other faculty members, I will only recommend you only if your current supervisor recommends. You should attach a copy of the consent in the email, otherwise I will have to personally call and confirm with him/her before giving the LOR.
  <br/>Thank you</span>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Once I give you consent to give LOR by replying to your email, you may put my official email address sajid(at)eee.buet.ac.bd in the application portal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For convenience, please submit the LOR request of ALL the universities at once. It is much easier for me to finish the LOR submission process in one sitting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I forget to submit the LOR, please send me an email reminder 1 day before the deadline.</p>
</li>
