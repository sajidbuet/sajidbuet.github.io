    abstract = {Conventional plasmonic materials, namely, noble metals, hamper the realization of practical plasmonic devices due to their intrinsic limitations, such as lack of capabilities to tune in real time their optical properties, failure to assimilate with CMOS standards, and severe degradation at increased temperatures. Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) is a promising alternative plasmonic material throughout the near‑ and mid‑infrared wavelengths. In addition to compatibility with established silicon‑based fabrication procedures, TCOs provide great flexibility in the design and optimization of plasmonic devices because their intrinsic optical properties can be tailored and dynamically tuned. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate metal‑oxide metasurfaces operating as quarter‑wave plates (QWPs) over a broad near‑infrared (NIR) range from $1.75$--$2.5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. We employ zinc oxide highly doped with gallium (Ga:ZnO) as the plasmonic constituent material of the metasurfaces and fabricate arrays of orthogonal nanorod pairs. Our Ga:ZnO metasurfaces provide a high degree of circular polarization across two distinct optical bands in the NIR. Flexible broadband tunability of the QWP metasurfaces is achieved by significant shifts of their optical bands.},

Drastic modifications of the fundamental mode profile along with changes in the mode confinement and propagation loss are found when varying the ridge height. The main mode characteristics (effective mode index, propagation length, and mode profile) are determined from the experimental amplitude- and phase-resolved near-field images and compared with the simulations. The possibility of strongly influencing the mode properties along with subwavelength confinement found simultaneously with relatively long propagation can further be exploited in mode shaping and sensing applications.},

Holograms of three individual component colors (red, green, and blue) are demonstrated in transmission mode, and a scheme for generating polychromatic hologram is illustrated.

    abstract = {Optical metasurfaces are judicously engineered electromagnetic interfaces that can control and manipulate many of light’s quintessential properties, such as amplitude, phase, and polarization. These artificial surfaces are composed of subwavelength arrays of optical antennas that experience resonant light-matter interaction with incoming electromagnetic radiation. Their ability to arbitrarily engineer optical interactions has generated considerable excitement and interest in recent years and is a promising methodology for miniaturizing optical components for applications in optical communication systems, imaging, sensing, and optical manipulation. However, development of optical metasurfaces requires progress and solutions to inherent challenges, namely large losses often associated with the resonant structures; large-scale, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible nanofabrication techniques; and incorporation of active control elements. Furthermore, practical metasurface devices require robust operation in high-temperature environments, caustic chemicals, and intense electromagnetic fields. Although these challenges 
are substantial, optical metasurfaces remain in their infancy, and novel material platforms that offer resilient, low-loss, and tunable metasurface designs are driving new and promising routes for overcoming these hurdles. In this review, we discuss the different material platforms in the literature for various applications of metasurfaces, including refractory plasmonic materials, epitaxial noble 
metal, silicon, graphene, phase change materials, and metal oxides. We identify the key advantages of each material platform and review the breakthrough devices that were made possible with each material. Finally, we provide an outlook for emerging metasurface devices and

    abstract = {Since ancient times, plasmonic structural coloring has inspired humanity; glassmakers achieved vibrant colors by doping glass with metal nanoparticles to craft beautiful objects such as the Roman Lycurgus cup and stained glass. These lovely color filtering effects are a consequence of the resonant coupling of light and free electrons in metal nanoparticles, known as surface plasmons. Thanks to the continuing improvement of nanofabrication technology, the dimensions of nanoparticles and structures can now be precisely engineered to form “optical nanoantennas,” allowing for control of optical response at an unprecedented level. Recently, the field of plasmonic structural coloring has seen extensive growth. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of various plasmonic color filtering approaches and highlight their uses in a broad palette of applications. Various surface plasmon resonance modes employed in the plasmonic color filtering effect are discussed. We first review the development of the pioneering static plasmonic colors achieved with invariant optical nanoantennas and ambient environment, then we address a variety of emerging approaches that enable dynamic color tuning, erasing, and restoring. These dynamic color filters are capable of actively changing the filtered colors and carrying more color information states than the static systems. Thus, they open an avenue to high-density data storage, information encryption, and plasmonic information processing. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future perspectives in this exciting research area.},

For example, metasurfaces have been demonstrated to produce unusual scattering properties of incident plane waves or to guide and modulate surface waves to obtain desired radiation properties. These properties have been employed, for example, to create innovative wireless receivers and transmitters. In addition, metasurfaces have recently been proposed to confine electromagnetic waves, thereby avoiding undesired leakage of energy and increasing the overall efficiency of electromagnetic instruments and devices. The main advantages of metasurfaces with respect to the existing conventional technology include their low cost, low level of absorption in comparison with bulky metamaterials, and easy integration due to their thin profile. Due to these advantages, they are promising candidates for real-world solutions to overcome the challenges posed by the next generation of transmitters and receivers of future high-rate communication systems that require highly precise and efficient antennas, sensors, active components, filters, and integrated technologies. This Roadmap is aimed at binding together the experiences of prominent researchers in the field of metasurfaces, from which explanations for the physics behind the extraordinary properties of these structures shall be provided from viewpoints of diverse theoretical backgrounds.

Numerical investigation reveals that the metastructure exhibits a conspicuous changeover from $\sim$ 99\% absorption to very poor interaction with the operating light depending on the switching states of the GST, ending up with 85\% modulation depth and only 0.58 dB insertion loss. Due to noticeable differences in optical responses, we can demonstrate a high extinction ratio of 28 dB and a commendable FOM of 49, so far the best modulation performance in this wavelength window. In addition, real-time tracking of the reflectance during phase transition manifests high-speed switching expending low energy per cycle, on the order of sub-nJ.

    abstract = {The conventional fiber communication band of 1.55 $\mu$m is reaching its limit attributable to the escalation in bandwidth requirements for high-speed and bulk data transmission. Researchers are exploring a 2 $\mu$m waveband for its higher capacity and low attenuation as a solution for the next generation communication technologies. Accordingly, here we report an optically engineered metasurface for this waveband for fiber coupling or lensing. The structure is polarization-insensitive and dynamically tunable between its reflective (OFF) and transmissive (ON) modes. For tunability, we incorporate a novel phase change material In3SbTe2 (IST) for its faster, non-volatile, and reversible metallic-to-insulator phase transition. The integration of indium tin oxide (ITO) as a micro-heater to electrically modulate the light by altering the phase of IST provides the device with additional functionality for point-of-care applications. Using the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) technique, we have achieved a modulation depth of 90\%. The focusing efficiency is as high as 76\% and the ON-OFF switching ratio of the optimized lens is 26 dB. The multilayer insertion of thin IST ensures uniform phase transition with switching energy as low as 232.98 nJ/$\mu$m^2. Thus, with remarkable performance at 2 $\mu$m and dynamic multifunctionality, our proposed device will revolutionize the upcoming telecommunication technologies and beyond.},

    abstract = {This study introduces a dual-band plasmonic absorber designed for simultaneous sensing applications in the near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions. The absorber, composed of silver nanostructures on a metal plate with a dielectric spacer, exhibits a combination of localized and gap surface plasmon resonances, resulting in two distinct absorption peaks in the theoretical analysis conducted using numerical simulations. The two absorption peaks are located in the NIR band (1366 nm) and the MIR band (2683 nm), with impressive absorption rates of 99.5\&\#x0025; and 99.99\&\#x0025;, respectively. Numerical simulations further validate the sensor\&\#x2019;s high refractive index sensitivity of 1550 nm/RIU, enabling the detection of biomolecules, proteins, viruses, and various solutes in aqueous solutions. Along with the significant resonance shift, the absorber offers two working windows in distinct IR regions and the flexibility to select wavelengths in both bands simultaneously, thereby expanding its application range in environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and chemical sensing.},

@article{J024,
    abstract = {The hybrid metal-dielectric nanostructures (HMDN) are promising candidates to address the ohmic loss by conventional nanostructures in photovoltaic applications by strong confinement and high scattering directivity. In this study, we present a c-\ce{Si}/\ce{TiO2} heterojunction thin film solar cell (TFSC) where a pair of triangular HMDN comprised of \ce{Ag} and \ce{AZO} was utilized to enhance the longer wavelength light absorption. The presence of the \ce{TiO2} inverted pyramid layer, in combination with the \ce{ITO} and \ce{SiO2}-based pyramid layers at the front, enhanced the shorter wavelength light absorption by increasing the optical path and facilitating the coupling of incoming light in photonic mode. Consequently, the average absorption by 1000 nm thick photoactive layer reached 83.32 \% for AM 1.5G within the wavelength range of 300 – 1100 nm which was investigated by employing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.  The electric field profile and current density profile demonstrated the respective contributions of each layer in the absorption of light at shorter and longer wavelengths. The structure exhibited a short circuit current density ($J_{sc}$) of 37.96 mA/cm$^2$ and a power conversion efficiency ($PCE$) of 17.42 \%. The efficiency of our proposed structure experienced a maximum relative change of 0.34 \% when a polarized light was exposed with an angle of 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$. The incorporation of self-heating in non-isothermal conditions reduced $PCE$ by 13.77 \%.  In addition, the comparative analysis to assess the impact of HMDN on our structure revealed a 4.54 \% increase in $PCE$ of the structure with metallic nanostructures, paving the way for the utilization of HMDN to enhance the performance of TFSC.},

    abstract = {Researchers have shown considerable interest in two-dimensional silicon carbide recently because of its relatively high exciton binding energy and wide bandgap. This article focuses on analyzing and studying first-principles density functional theory to assess the influence of strain on the phonon, mechanical, optical, and electronic characteristics of SiC. Additionally, we investigate the band structure for spin-orbit coupling. The SiC exhibits an indirect bandgap, but applying tensile strain it shows a direct bandgap. Although the bandgap decreases under tensile stresses and the SOC effect, it increases when exposed to compressive pressures. Furthermore, the optical characteristics of single-layer SiC, such as the refractive index, electron energy loss spectra, dielectric spectra, and absorption coefficient, showcase its remarkable capacity to effectively absorb light in both the visible and infrared (IR) regions. SiC exhibits dynamic and mechanical stability under compressive strain up to 3\% and under tensile strain up to +6.},

@article{J026,
    abstract = {In this article, we report, for the first time, broadband multifunctional metasurfaces with more than four distinct functionalities. The constituent meta-atoms combine two different phase change materials, $\mathrm{VO_2}$ and $\mathrm{Sb_2S_3}$ in a multi-stage configuration. Finite-difference time-domain simulations demonstrate a broadband reflection amplitude switching between the four states in visible range due to the enhanced cavity length modulation effect from the cascaded Fabry-Perot cavities, overcoming the inherent small optical contrast between the phase change material (PCM) states. This, along with the reflection phase control between the four states, allows us to incorporate both amplitude and phase-dependent properties in the same metasurface - achromatic deflection, wavelength beam splitting, achromatic focusing, and broadband absorption, overcoming the limitations of previous functionality switching mechanisms for the visible band. We have used a Tandem Neural network-based inverse design scheme to ensure the stringent requirements of different states are realized. We have used two forward networks for predicting the reflection amplitude and phase for a meta-atom within the pre-defined design space. The excellent prediction capability of these surrogate models is utilized to train the reverse network. The inverse design network, trained with a labeled data set, is capable of efficiently navigating through the vast parametric space to produce the optimized meta-units given the desired figure-of-merits in terms of reflection amplitude and phase for the four states. The optical characteristics of two inverse-designed metasurfaces have been evaluated as test cases for two different sets of design parameters in the four states. Both structures demonstrate the four desired broadband functionalities while closely matching the design requirements, suggesting their potential in visible-range portable medical imaging devices. The findings of this work will open new horizons for active metasurface design with broadband complex multifunctionalities in different spectral bands.},
